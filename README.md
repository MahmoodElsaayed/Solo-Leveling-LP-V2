# Solo-Leveling-LP-V2
- This is the same project as it' [predecessor](https://github.com/MahmoodElsaayed/Solo-Leveling-LP) with a couple of foundational changes in mind.
    - static layout and absolute units (instead of clumsily trying to make it responsive when I don't have the knowledge I decided to focus on applying what I learned instead)
    - trying to use cleaner and more consistent code
    - writing css rulesets with re-usability in mind
